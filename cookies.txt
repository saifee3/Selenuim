### **Step-by-Step Guide: Using "Cookies Editor" Extension to Export Cookies**


### **Step 1: Install the "Cookies Editor" Extension**
1. Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
2. Go to the extension store:
   - **Chrome**: [Cookies Editor on Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookies-editor/)
   - **Firefox**: [Cookies Editor on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-editor/)
3. Click **Add to Browser** and install the extension.

### **Step 2: Navigate to the Target Website**
1. Open a new tab and go to the website you want to extract cookies from (e.g., `https://www.potterybarn.com`).
2. Log in or perform any necessary actions to ensure the cookies are active.

### **Step 3: Open the "Cookies Editor" Extension**
1. Click on the **Cookies Editor** icon in your browser’s toolbar.
2. The extension will open in a new tab, showing all cookies for the current website.

### **Step 4: Export Cookies**
1. In the **Cookies Editor** interface, click the **Export** button (usually at the top or bottom of the page).
2. Choose **Export as JSON** (this is the most common format for cookies).
3. Copy the exported JSON data to your clipboard.

### **Step 5: Save Cookies to a `.txt` File**
1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).
2. Paste the copied JSON data into the text editor.
3. Save the file as `cookies.txt` in your project’s `config/` folder.

### **Step 7: Use the Cookies in Your Script**
1. In your Python script, load the `cookies.txt` file using the `json` module:
   ```python
   import json

   with open('config/cookies.txt', 'r') as file:
       cookies = json.load(file)
   ```
2. Add the cookies to your Selenium WebDriver session as shown in your script.
